#### What is this?

A simple object arena.

You want to build a doubly linked list? Or maybe a bidirectional tree? Perhaps an even more
complicated object graph?

Managing ownership and lifetimes might be tough then. Your options boil down to:

1. Use unsafe code to escape Rust's ownership rules.
2. Wrap every object in `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.
3. Use `Vec<T>` to store objects, then access them using indices.

If the last option seems most appealing to you, perhaps `Arena<T>` is for you.
It will provide a more convenient API than a plain `Vec<T>`.

#### Examples

Some data structures built using `Arena<T>`:

* [Doubly linked list](https://github.com/stjepang/vec-arena/blob/master/examples/linked-list.rs)
* [Splay tree](https://github.com/stjepang/vec-arena/blob/master/examples/splay-tree.rs)
